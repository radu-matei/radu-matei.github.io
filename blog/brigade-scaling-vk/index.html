        <p><em><a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/04/01/brigade-kubernetes-serverless-tutorial">This article originally appeared on the Microsoft open source blog</a></em>.</p>
<p>Microservices built on Kubernetes are fast becoming one of the core scenarios
where computing is done, and Kubernetes development and operations skills are
therefore becoming a larger part of any cloud-native toolset. This article shows
how to use some of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and
<a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">CNCF sandbox projects</a> together to build
a Kubernetes-native application that listens for events and then runs serverless
pipelines on Virtual Kubelet instances, each of which are dynamically created
(and recycled when the pipeline is done).</p>
<p>The CNCF Sandbox projects used in this article are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://cloudevents.io">Cloud Events</a>, a specification for describing event
data in a common way</li>
<li><a href="https://brigade.sh">Brigade</a>, a Kubernetes-native service that creates
structured container pipelines</li>
<li><a href="https://virtual-kubelet.io/">Virtual Kubelet</a>, an open-source Kubernetes
kubelet implementation that defers its internal execution to another system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Brigade and an implementation of Virtual Kubelet based on Azure Container
Instances (ACI) are installed using the CNCF <a href="https://helm.sh">Helm</a> project, an
installer for Kubernetes applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, we are
<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/03/28/announcing-brigade-1-0-new-kind-of-distributed-application/">happy to announce that Brigade</a>
is now a CNCF <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/">sandbox</a> project, a
major step for the Brigade community, collaborating on a first-class scripting
runtime for constructing container pipelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why these projects? The nature of event-driven applications is that the load is
often unpredictable, and allocating compute power for a specific workload can be
quite difficult, and inefficient from a cost perspective. Brigade listens for
Cloud Events and manages the pipelines in a Kubernetes cluster, but handling
unexpected load is where we introduce Virtual Kubelet — a CNCF project that
allows us to schedule Kubernetes pods on virtual nodes, backed by components
other than VMs. Virtual Kubelet has multiple providers available, with one of
them being Azure Container Instances (ACI) — a service that allows you to
schedule and execute containers on Azure’s infrastructure, billed by the second.
It turns out that this is a really good match, since Brigade allows you to
execute container pipelines, and events often do not require long periods of
compute; they can be &ldquo;bursty&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-brigade-work">How does Brigade work?</h3>
<p>Brigade uses a few components to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>a controller, which looks for events in a certain namespace.</li>
<li>a gateway, which translates external events (which can come from a git repo,
webhooks, or any other event source).</li>
<li>optionally, an API to help us interact with CLIs or web frontends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when an event is fired, the Brigade controller will schedule a worker pod,
which executes the JavaScript pipeline of your project, and starts scheduling
all the jobs defined.</p>
<p>This is the interesting part — you don’t have to provision infrastructure for
the jobs you define — they can be scheduled by Virtual Kubelet on Azure
Container Instances, and be billed by the second for the time when your jobs
run.</p>
<p>You can have a number of nodes for your regular workloads, and use Brigade with
Virtual Kubelet for the event-driven pipelines. You can run as many jobs in
parallel as needed, without worrying about provisioning infrastructure, or the
cost associated with it. On top of that, you can use any Kubernetes in any
cloud, or on-premises, and scale through Azure when needed.</p>
<p>By the end of this article, we will have a Kubernetes cluster with one actual VM
node, a Virtual Kubelet node backed by ACI, and Brigade, configured to schedule
jobs on the virtual node.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are interested, you can <a href="https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/design/">read more about the Brigade architecture in
this document</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="configuring-brigade-virtual-kubelet-and-aci">Configuring Brigade, Virtual Kubelet, and ACI</h3>
<p>Here’s a list of the things we are going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, you need a Kubernetes cluster — if you don’t already have one, you can
<a href="https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/">get started with a free Azure subscription here</a>,
use a Minikube cluster, or any other cloud-hosted Kubernetes cluster.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that if you use a Minikube cluster, you won’t be able to create services
with public IPs, or publicly exposed ingress objects. You can still follow
along, and manually trigger jobs through the Brigade CLI.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>we also need to <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/">configure Helm</a>.</li>
<li>optionally, you can configure an <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx">Nginx ingress controller</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/">Cert-Manager</a> to automatically provision TLS ingress objects in
your cluster, <a href="https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/ingress/">as described in the Brigade
documentation</a>.</li>
<li>the document above also explains how to deploy Brigade if you configure a
cluster with ingress and TLS. If you don&rsquo;t want to configure an ingress
controller, deploying Brigade can be done with Helm:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ helm repo add brigade https://azure.github.io/brigade-charts
$ helm install brigade/brigade --name brigade --set genericGateway.enabled=true --set genericGateway.service.type=&lt;LoadBalancer/ClusterIP&gt;
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>If you have a cloud-hosted Kubernetes cluster, it should be able to
automatically provision <code>LoadBalancer</code> type services with a public IP. If not,
you can choose a <code>ClusterIP</code> type service, but keep in mind that this service
will <em>not</em> be publicly exposed, and triggering jobs will only be available
through the <code>brig</code> CLI, or from inside the cluster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The setup we are using for this article is the one described in <a href="https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/ingress/">the Brigade
documentation that covers configuring ingress objects with
TLS</a>. Here&rsquo;s how the <code>brigade</code> namespace should
look:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ kubectl get deployment,service,ingress --namespace brigade

</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Note that the subdomain used for provisioning ingress objects is
<code>*.kube.radu.sh</code> &ndash; if you own a domain, and have access to configuring the
DNS for it, you should be able to setup the ingress controller according to
the document referenced above.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This ingress endpoint allows Brigade to accept events in the <a href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvents v2
format</a>, a CNCF industry specification which formalizes event
schemas used for different systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that there is another endpoint in the same Brigade gateway which allows
arbitrary JSON schema events, so if your system produces other JSON schemas,
you can use them without changing the format. See the <a href="https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/genericgateway/">document about the
Brigade generic gateway</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cluster provisioned for this article is a 1 node AKS cluster:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
aks-agentpool-35064155-0   Ready    agent   19h   v1.12.6

$ kubectl top nodes
NAME                       CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
aks-agentpool-35064155-0   1110m        57%    1579Mi          30%
</code></pre><p>This means we&rsquo;re only paying for 1 virtual machine node (as the Kubernetes
control plane in AKS is free). So how would we schedule tens, or hundreds of
jobs on this small, 1 node cluster, which is already at 57% CPU load? We are
going to do this using Virtual Kubelet and Azure Container Instances.</p>
<p>For the next part, you will need an <a href="TODO">Azure subscription</a> which has
access to creating Container Instances, as well as access to creating an Azure
Service Principal.</p>
<p>If you are running your Kubernetes cluster on AKS, deploying Virtual Kubelet is
extremely easy:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ az aks install-connector --resource-group &lt;aks cluster rg&gt; --name &lt;aks cluster name&gt;
</code></pre><p>For any other Kubernetes clusters, you can follow <a href="https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/tree/master/providers/azure#manual-set-up">the official instructions
from the Virtual Kubelet repo for the ACI provider</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that your subscription must be able to create container instances
&ndash; to enable this provider, run
<code>az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if everything worked correctly, we should have a second node in our
cluster, <code>virtual-kubelet</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
aks-agentpool-35064155-0   Ready    agent   40h   v1.12.6
virtual-kubelet            Ready    agent   11h   v1.13.1-vk-v0.7.4-44-g4f3bd20e-dev
</code></pre><p>Now that everything is up and running, let&rsquo;s create a new Brigade project:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ brig project create
? Project Name testing/brigade-vk

$ brig project list
NAME              	ID
testing/brigade-vk	brigade-f21cf24721ff5303ba21dd5360af71d447d0549b844329206d780c
</code></pre><p>There are a couple of thing to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>we are not going to create a CI pipeline, so we are not going to use the clone
URL, and we are setting the VCS Sidecar to <code>NONE</code>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you plan to use the Brigade gateway for CloudEvents, you can find more
details about it in <a href="https://docs.brigade.sh/topics/genericgateway/">the Brigade documentation</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s use the project we just created to test a pipeline. We need a
JavaScript pipeline that creates a Brigade job, and schedules it on the
<code>virtual-kubelet</code> node we just created:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript=" data-lang="javascript=">// save this as brigade.js
const { events, Job } = require(&#34;@azure/brigadier&#34;);

events.on(&#34;exec&#34;, (brigadeEvent, project) =&gt; {
  var hello = new Job(&#34;linux-job&#34;);
  hello.image = &#34;alpine:3.4&#34;;
  hello.tasks = [&#34;echo Hello Brigade from Azure&#34;];

  hello.host.name = &#34;virtual-kubelet&#34;;
  hello.resourceRequests.cpu = &#34;1&#34;;
  hello.resourceRequests.memory = &#34;1G&#34;;

  hello.run();
});
</code></pre><p>Breaking down the <code>brigade.js</code> file:</p>
<ul>
<li>we first import <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/brigadier"><code>@azure/brigadier</code></a> library, which contains
all Brigade job definitions.</li>
<li>then, when an <code>exec</code> event is triggered, we create a new Job, and we run a
single task, which echoes a message.</li>
<li>we schedule the job to run on the virtual node we created, and set resource
requests for CPU and memory.</li>
<li>then we run start the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Triggering an <code>exec</code> event can be done through the <code>brig</code> CLI, so if your setup
doesn&rsquo;t include public IP services, or ingresses, you can still test this,
provided you configured Virtual Kubelet correctly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ brig exec testing/brigade-vk -f brigade.js
Event created. Waiting for worker pod named &#34;brigade-worker-01d5c5g11spb27fzjwkjs7gktw&#34;.

</code></pre><p>So let&rsquo;s see what is happening in our cluster when a job is scheduled:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                               READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
brigade-worker-01d5c58r90v5ernrsy6dkvcf5n          0/1     Completed    0          65s
linux-job-01d5c58r90v5ernrsy6dkvcf5n               0/1     Terminated   0          29s
</code></pre><p>The pods that we are interested in are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Brigade worker &ndash; as we said before, this pod is scheduled whenever an
event is triggered, it executes the <code>brigade.js</code> file associated with a
project, and creates all the jobs defined.</li>
<li>the <code>linux-job</code> pod is our job that was scheduled on the Virtual Kubelet node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking the logs of the job pod:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ kubectl logs linux-job-01d5c58r90v5ernrsy6dkvcf5n
Hello Brigade from Azure
</code></pre><p>Since the pod was scheduled on the Virtual Kubelet node, which is backed by
Azure Container Instances, we should also see the container created in the Azure
portal:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6598Rdl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So at this point, we have all pieces put together.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-parallelized-jobs-with-brigade-and-virtual-kubelet">Scaling parallelized jobs with Brigade and Virtual Kubelet</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s assume we have a parallel job that we need to execute &ndash; it could be
<a href="https://github.com/seanmck/aci-wordcount">counting utterances of words in a given text</a>, it could be
training a machine learning model using a large data set, or any job that can be
parallelized.</p>
<p>If we only have a relatively small number of executions (countdown, word count,
data set size), the job can be performed sequentially, by a single instance &ndash;
otherwise, we can parallelize the job, and see vastly improved results.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, for our example, we only need a counter &ndash; and see how to
parallelize this using multiple Brigade jobs. The container we are going to run
as a Brigade job reads two environment variables, <code>COUNTDOWN_FROM</code>, and
<code>COUNTDOWN_TO</code>, and starts a loop where it echoes the current count, then sleeps
for one second, simulating a process that takes one second to complete.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say we need to execute the process 200 times &ndash; sequentially, it would
take 200 seconds, plus the time needed to schedule the pod, pull the image, and
start the execution.</p>
<p>In the following pipeline, we will simulate the execution of the process 200
times &ndash; in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>in parallel, by starting 20 Brigade jobs, and splitting the work evenly
between the two</li>
<li>in a sequential job, which does all 200 executions one after the other</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how we are using two core Brigade concepts - a Job, and a Group.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript=" data-lang="javascript=">const { events, Job, Group } = require(&#34;@azure/brigadier&#34;);

const parallelism = 20;

events.on(&#34;exec&#34;, (brigadeEvent, project) =&gt; {
  // Brigade grouping for jobs
  var g = new Group();

  for (i = 0; i &lt; parallelism; i++) {
    var job = new Job(`parallel-countdown-${i}`);
    job.image = &#34;ubuntu&#34;;
    job.shell = &#34;bash&#34;;
    job.tasks = [
      &#34;for((i=$COUNTDOWN_FROM;i&lt;=$COUNTDOWN_TO;i++)); do echo counting $i; sleep 1;  done&#34;,
    ];

    job.env = {
      COUNTDOWN_FROM: (i * 10).toString(),
      COUNTDOWN_TO: (i * 10 + 9).toString(),
    };

    job.host.name = &#34;virtual-kubelet&#34;;
    job.resourceRequests.cpu = &#34;1&#34;;
    job.resourceRequests.memory = &#34;1G&#34;;

    g.add(job);
  }

  var seq = new Job(&#34;sequential-countdown&#34;);
  seq.image = &#34;ubuntu&#34;;
  seq.shell = &#34;bash&#34;;
  seq.tasks = [
    &#34;for((i=$COUNTDOWN_FROM;i&lt;=$COUNTDOWN_TO;i++)); do echo counting $i; sleep 1;  done&#34;,
  ];

  seq.env = {
    COUNTDOWN_FROM: (0).toString(),
    COUNTDOWN_TO: (199).toString(),
  };

  seq.host.name = &#34;virtual-kubelet&#34;;
  seq.resourceRequests.cpu = &#34;1&#34;;
  seq.resourceRequests.memory = &#34;1G&#34;;

  g.add(seq);

  // runAll runs all jobs in parallel
  g.runAll();
});
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>In this scenario, we only start the jobs &ndash; however, with Brigade, we can get
the result of the execution, and take different actions based on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After we run this pipeline with <code>brig</code>, we can see both the parallel jobs, and
the sequential one starting at around the same time &ndash; then, the parralel jobs
start finishing, and the sequential one takes around 3 minutes longer to finish.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/m0R7yit.gif" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tool used to visualize the pipeline is <a href="https://github.com/slok/brigadeterm">Brigadeterm</a>, which
can also be used to get the job logs. There is currently a known bug which
marks job duration wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brigade also comes with a web dashboard &ndash; you can access it by executing
<code>brig dashboard</code> (and, if deployed in a different namespace, by passing the
<code>--namespace</code> flag). We can also see the difference between the parallel and
sequential execution:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9c7rZxy.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that we have a 1 node cluster, and all jobs are scheduled on top
of Azure Container Instances, allowing us to only pay for the few tens of
seconds our jobs are running.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Azure Container Instances have a quota of 100 container groups per
subscription &ndash; if you need more, a simple request with Azure Support can
help. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#container-instances-limits">azure-quotas</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we are using an <code>ubuntu</code> container, with a few commands &ndash; keep
in mind that you can use any container to run Brigade jobs, and you can run any
command that is available inside that container.</p>
<p>Now that we have everything working, we can programmatically call the Brigade
endpoint we configured with TLS and have our <code>brigade.js</code> file handle the event,
executing our pipeline.</p>
<p>The<code>brigade.js</code> file will have access to the incoming event, as well as to the
project information (notice the <code>brigadeEvent</code> and <code>project</code> objects in the
event handler).</p>
<p>At this point, you can use the <code>/cloudevents/v02/project-id/secret</code> endpoint in
the Brigade gateway we just exposed to send POST requests in the CloudEvents
format:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
    &#34;specversion&#34; : &#34;0.2&#34;,
    &#34;type&#34; : &#34;your.custom.event.type&#34;,
    &#34;source&#34; : &#34;event source&#34;,
    &#34;id&#34; : &#34;A234-1234-1234&#34;,
    &#34;time&#34; : &#34;2018-04-05T17:31:00Z&#34;,

    &#34;contenttype&#34; : &#34;json&#34;,
    &#34;data&#34; : {}
}
</code></pre><p>Then, simply listen for <code>cloudevent</code> or <code>simpleevent</code> events in <code>brigade.js</code>,
and you can execute your pipelines.</p>
