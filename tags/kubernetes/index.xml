      <title>Instant Scaling on Demand: Serverless Kubernetes with Brigade</title>
      <link>https://radu-matei.com/blog/brigade-scaling-vk/</link>

      <description>This article originally appeared on the Microsoft open source blog.&#xA;Microservices built on Kubernetes are fast becoming one of the core scenarios where computing is done, and Kubernetes development and operations skills are therefore becoming a larger part of any cloud-native toolset. This article shows how to use some of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and CNCF sandbox projects together to build a Kubernetes-native application that listens for events and then runs serverless pipelines on Virtual Kubelet instances, each of which are dynamically created (and recycled when the pipeline is done).</description>

      <title>Filter secrets from Kubernetes logs</title>
      <link>https://radu-matei.com/blog/filter-k8s-logs/</link>

      <description>Running any non-trivial application on Kubernetes will most likely require authorized access to other components - databases, storage buckets, APIs - all of which require a connection string or some sort of access key. Storing these values in Kubernetes is done through Secrets, and while there are plenty of ways to make sure the secrets are safe while at rest, as well as how to configure an external KMS provider, once the secret is injected into your application container, its value will be plain text.</description>

      <title>The state of debugging microservices on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>For as long as we have been writing software, we have also introduced bugs in our applications. Back when we were developing monoliths, we could simply start the IDE of choice, add a couple of breakpoints, step through the code and hopefully solve the issue. There was a single place where the application was running, where logs were visible and where the application could be diagnosed.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s article we will explore how to take a real-world application and start developing, debugging and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster and how to use a couple of open-source tools to make our lives easier in the process. Specifically, we will use Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, the newly released Kubernetes extension for VS Code and Draft to develop, debug and deploy is Helm itself.&#xA;Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.</description>

      <description>Application containers have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years. In recent months, Kubernetes has emerged as a popular solution for orchestrating these containers. While many turn to Kubernetes for its extensible architecture and vibrant open-source community, some still view Kubernetes as too difficult to use. Learn how to use Draft to simplify your cloud-native application development!</description>

      <description>In this article we will explore how to integrate Azure App Service and Kubernetes within the same Azure Virtual Network and consume Kubernetes services from an Azure App Service app without exposing them on the public Internet. There will be lots of situations when we want to use both the simplicity and features of a PaaS service (such as autoscaling, easy SSL, or any other cool feature) for a component and the flexibility of Kubernetes for others - in this article we will see how to achieve this without exposing services on the Internet.</description>
