This week, I joined Fermyon&amp;rsquo;s weekly live stream together with Sohan to talk about how I configured the cluster and to demonstrate running Spin applications on Kubernetes.
You can follow along this gist to set up your own cluster, and stay tuned for a full write-up on this setup.</description></item><item><title>Trying something new</title><link>https://radu-matei.com/notes/trying-something-new/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>radu@matei.ai (Radu Matei)</author><guid>https://radu-matei.com/notes/trying-something-new/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing on this blog since 2016. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about .NET, WebSockets, debugging microservices on Kubernetes, or about WebAssembly memory.
I rarely have the time to write lengthy blog posts anymore, and social media seems to be the worst place to have a conversation these days; so I stopped posting almost entirely.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to change that with a new notes section of my blog where I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write more by sharing something in-between a tweet and a fully fledged blog post.</description></item></channel></rss>
