[This article originally appeared in the Microsoft DeisLabs blog](https://deislabs.io/posts/wasi-nn-onnx).

[WASI NN][wasi-nn] is a proposal that allows WebAssembly guest modules running
outside the browser to perform neural network inferencing by using host-provided
implementations that can leverage CPU multi-threading, host optimizations, or
hardware devices such as GPUs or TPUs. This article explores the goals of WASI
NN, existing implementations, and details a new experimental implementation
targeting [ONNX, the Open Neural Network Exchange][onnx], which allows the usage
of models built with PyTorch or TensorFlow from guest WebAssembly modules.

> The implementation for ONNX runtimes with WASI NN [can be found on
> GitHub][repo].

The WASI Neural Network API is a new [WebAssembly System Interface][wasi]
proposal that allows guest WebAssembly modules running outside the browser, in
WASI runtimes, access to highly optimized inferencing runtimes for machine
learning workloads. Andrew Brown has an [excellent article on the
BytecodeAlliance blog about the motivations of WASI NN][ab-1], but in short, the
proposed API describes a way for guest modules to load a pre-built machine
learning model, provide input tensors, and execute inferences on the highly
optimized runtime provided by the WASI host. One of the most important things to
note about the WASI NN API is that it is model agnostic, and so far quite
simple:

- `load` a model using one or more opaque byte arrays
- `init_execution_context` and bind some tensors to it using `set_input`
- `compute` the ML inference using the bound context
- retrieve the inference result tensors using `get_output`

As it is obvious from the API, there is no assumption around the way the neural
network has been built -- as long as the host implementation understands the
opaque byte array as a neural network model, it can `load` it and perform
inferences when `compute` is called using the input tensors. The first
[implementation for WASI NN in Wasmtime is for the OpenVINOâ„¢
platform][wasmtime-impl], and Andrew Brown has [another excellent article
describing the implementation details][ab-2]. This article explores how to add
an implementation that performs inferences on the host for ONNX models.

[ONNX, or the Open Neural Network Exchange][onnx], is an open format which
defines a common set of machine learning operators and file format that ensure
the interoperability between different frameworks (such as PyTorch, TensorFlow,
or CNTK), with a common runtime and hardware access through ONNX runtimes. Two
of the most popular machine learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, have
libraries that allow developers to convert built models to the ONNX format, then
run them using an ONNX runtime. This means that by adding ONNX support to WASI
NN, guest WebAssembly modules can perform inferences for both PyTorch and
TensorFlow models converted to the common format -- which makes it even easier
to use a wider array of models from the ecosystem.

Because the WASI ecosystem is written in Rust, an ONNX implementation for WASI
NN needs the underlying runtime to either be built in Rust, or have Rust
bindings for its API -- and this article describes building and using two such
implementations for WASI NN, each presenting their own advantages and drawbacks
that will be discussed later:

- one based on the [native ONNX runtime][msft], which uses [community-built Rust
  bindings][bindings] to the runtime's C API.
- one based on the [Tract crate][tract], which is a native inference engine for
  running ONNX models, written in Rust.

### Implementing WASI NN for a new runtime

Implementing WASI NN for a new runtime means providing an implementation for
[the WITX definitions of the API][witx]. For example, the API used to load a new
model is defined as follows:

```
(module $wasi_ephemeral_nn
  (import "memory" (memory))

  (@interface func (export "load")
    (param $builder $graph_builder_array)
    (param $encoding $graph_encoding)
    (param $target $execution_target)

    (result $error (expected $graph (error $nn_errno)))
  )
)
```

Then, Wasmtime tooling can be used to generate Rust bindings and traits for the
API that can then be implemented for a specific runtime:

```
pub trait WasiEphemeralNn {
    fn load(
        &mut self,
        builder: &GraphBuilderArray,
        encoding: GraphEncoding,
        target: ExecutionTarget,
    ) -> Result<Graph>;
}
```

> An article describing how to implement a new WebAssembly API from WITX for
> Wasmtime can be found [here][witx-post].

The two implementations (the one that uses the ONNX C API and the other using
Tract) are fairly similar -- they both implement the Rust trait defined by
`WasiEphemeralNn`, which defines the following functions from the WASI NN API:

- `load` -- this provides the actual model as opaque byte arrays, as well as the
  model encoding (ONNX for this implementation) and the execution target. This
  function has to store the model bytes so that guests can later instantiate it.
- `init_execution_context` instantiates an already loaded model -- but because
  input tensors have not been provided yet, it only creates the environment
  necessary for the guest to `set_input`.
- `set_input` can be called multiple times, with the guest setting the input
  tensors and their shapes.
- `compute` is called by the guest once it has defined all input tensors, and it
  performs the actual inference using the optimized runtime.
- `get_output` is called by the guest once the runtime finished an inference,
  which then writes the `i-th` output tensor to a buffer the guest supplied.

During their lifetime, guests can perform any number of inferences, on any
number of different neural network models. This is assured by the internal state
of the runtime, which keeps track different concurrent requests (the specific
implementations [can be found on GitHub][impl]). The project also comes with a
binary helper that mimics the Wasmtime CLI, with added support for both ONNX
runtime implementations.

First, let's consider [the official ONNX implementation][msft] -- it is built in
C++, and provides a highly efficient runtime for inferencing. It comes with
[APIs for a number of different languages][onnx-api], including Python, Java,
JavaScript, C#, or Objective-C, all of them through accessing the ONNX shared
libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.dylib`, depending on the operating system). To
use them from Rust, [the `onnxruntime-rs` crate][bindings] offers bindings to
the underlying C API of the runtime, with a nice wrapper that makes using this
API from Rust much easier than directly accessing the `unsafe` functionality
exposed by the C API. Keep in mind, however, that this is not an official
project, and currently targets a slightly older ONNX version, 1.6.

To execute the inference using the native ONNX runtime, first download [the ONNX
runtime 1.6 shared library][sl] and unarchive it, then build the project (this
is temporary, until proper release binaries are provided in the repository). At
this point, the helper `wasmtime-onnx` binary can be used to execute WebAssembly
modules that use WASI NN to perform inferences. The following examples use [the
integration tests from the project repository][tests], and use the
[SqueezeNet][sq] and [MobileNetV2][mb] models for image classification.

```plaintext
$ cargo build --release
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<PATH-TO-ONNX>/onnx/onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.6.0/lib \
RUST_LOG=wasi_nn_onnx_wasmtime=info,wasmtime_onnx=info \
         ./target/release/wasmtime-onnx \
        tests/rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasi-nn-rust.wasm \
        --dir tests/testdata \
        --invoke test_squeezenet

integration::inference_image:
results for image "tests/testdata/images/n04350905.jpg"
class=n04350905 suit of clothes (834); probability=0.21431354
class=n03763968 military uniform (652); probability=0.18545522

execution time: 74.3381ms with runtime: C
```

The previous command can be translated as follows: using the `wasmtime-onnx`
binary, which provides a host implementation for performing ONNX inferences
using the native ONNX runtime, start the WebAssembly module `wasi-nn-rust.wasm`
and invoke the `test_squeezenet` function, which loads the SqueezeNet model and
performs an inference on a picture of [Grace Hopper][gh]. Because the project
does not yet enable GPU usage for the native ONNX runtime (see issue
[#9](https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-nn-onnx/issues/9)), the inference is
performed on the CPU, and is multi-threaded by default. This means that after
GPU is enabled, the inference time will be even lower. But this comes at the
cost of ease of configuration -- because this runtime uses bindings to the ONNX
runtime's C API, the shared libraries first have to be downloaded and configured
(same for the GPU support, where in addition to the proper ONNX release with GPU
support, the graphics drivers will also have to be properly configured).

This is the main reason a second implementation is provided here --
[Tract][tract] is an ONNX runtime implemented purely in Rust, and does not need
any shared libraries. However, it only passes _successfully about 85% of ONNX
backend tests_, it does not implement internal multi-threading or GPU access,
and the inference times on the CPU are slightly higher than for the native ONNX
runtime. The same binary, ONNX model, and WebAssembly module can be used to run
the same inference -- the only difference is passing the `--tract` flag,
informing the runtime to use the alternative implementation for ONNX:

```plaintext
$ RUST_LOG=wasi_nn_onnx_wasmtime=info,wasmtime_onnx=info \
         ./target/release/wasmtime-onnx \
        tests/rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasi-nn-rust.wasm \
        --dir tests/testdata \
        --invoke test_squeezenet \
        --tract

integration::inference_image:
results for image "tests/testdata/images/n04350905.jpg"

execution time: 90.6102ms with runtime: Tract
```

The relative performance between the two can be seen in the inference times, and
in most cases, the Tract runtime will yield slightly higher latency on the same
hardware -- but the fact that it comes with no runtime dependencies means that,
for non-critical scenarios, or when running on CPU-only machines, configuring
and running this project becomes significantly easier (i.e. downloading a single
binary).

### Initial _relative_ performance

A few notes on performance:

- this represents _very early_ data, based on a limited number of runs and
  models, and should only be interpreted in terms of the relative performance
  that can be expected between running the same inference natively, through WASI
  NN, or purely in WebAssembly.
- the ONNX runtime is running multi-threaded on the CPU _only_, as the GPU is
  not yet enabled.
- in each case, all tests are executing the same ONNX model on the same images.
- all WebAssembly modules (both those built with WASI NN and the ones running
  pure Wasm) are run with [Wasmtime v0.28][28], with caching enabled, and no
  other special optimizations. For the WebAssembly examples, Wasm module
  instantiation time on the tested hardware accounts for around 16 ms on
  average, so in reality, the actual inference time is very close to native
  performance.
- there are known limitations in both runtimes that, when fixed, should also
  significantly improve the inference performance.
- pre- and post-processing of input and output tensors still takes place in
  WebAssembly, so as runtimes, compilers, and libraries add support for
  [SIMD][simd], this should also be improved.

The following charts represent the total inference times for running the
SqueezeNet and MobileNetV2 models on CPU-only hardware, natively, with WASI NN,
and then purely in WebAssembly.

<!-- ![WASI NN SqueezeNet performance](./static/img/article-photos/wasi-nn-onnx/squeezenet.png) -->

![WASI NN SqueezeNet performance](/img/article-photos/wasi-nn-onnx/squeezenet.png)

Being a much smaller module, the inference times for SqueezeNet are smaller
relative to MobileNetV2, but the relative performance difference can still be
observed:

<!-- ![WASI NN MobileNetV2 performance](./static/img/article-photos/wasi-nn-onnx/mobilenetv2.png) -->

![WASI NN MobileNetV2 performance](/img/article-photos/wasi-nn-onnx/mobilenetv2.png)

As more modules and GPU support are added, the performance benchmarks will be
updated, but there is a trend expected to be seen -- regardless of the neural
network used, the native ONNX runtime should be faster (or much faster, when GPU
support is enabled) than the Tract runtime, which in turn is around 3 to 4 times
faster than running purely in WebAssembly, with both WASI NN implementations
slightly slower than their natively run counterparts -- the difference being
mainly because of the module instantiation times.

### Writing WebAssembly modules, pre- and post-processing

Building WebAssembly modules that use WASI NN has to be done by using the client
bindings -- in this case, a [slightly modified version that includes the ONNX
variant for the graph encoding `enum`][nn-bindings]. This API is still very
early, and requires the use of `unsafe` Rust in quite a few places, but future
releases should provide a much safer API that will use [`ndarray`][ndarray].

The one thing that is always required when performing inference on a pre-built
neural network is understanding how input data has to be pre-processed when
generating the input tensors, and how to interpret the output tensors -- in the
case of SqueezeNet and MobileNetV2, _the images have to be loaded in to a range
of `[0, 1]` and then normalized using `mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and
`std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`._ After the inference, _post-processing involves
calculating the `softmax` probability scores for each class and sorting them to
report the most probable classes._ This is, of course, dependent on how each
neural network is built, and should be understood before trying to perform
inferences, and usually, [the ONNX models repository][models] provides enough
information and Python implementations on how to perform pre- and
post-processing, which can be adapted into the language used to build the Wasm
module. For example, let's explore how to pre-process images for the two models
(more Rust examples can be found in the [Tract repository][tract-examples]):

```
pub fn image_to_tensor<
  S: Into<String> +
  AsRef<std::path::Path> + Debug
>(
    path: S,
    height: u32,
    width: u32,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>, Error> {
    let image = image::imageops::resize(
        &image::open(path)?,
        width,
        height,
        ::image::imageops::FilterType::Triangle,
    );


    let mut array = ndarray::Array::from_shape_fn(
      (1, 3, 224, 224),
      |(_, c, j, i)| {
        let pixel = image.get_pixel(i as u32, j as u32);
        let channels = pixel.channels();

        // range [0, 255] -> range [0, 1]
        (channels[c] as f32) / 255.0
    });

    // Normalize channels to
    // mean and standard deviation on each channel.
    let mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406];
    let std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225];
    for c in 0..3 {
        let mut channel_array = array.slice_mut(s![0, c, .., ..]);
        channel_array -= mean[c];
        channel_array /= std[c];
    }

    Ok(f32_vec_to_bytes(array.as_slice().unwrap().to_vec()))
}
```

This is the Rust implementation for the pre-processing steps described above --
load the image, resize it to 224 x 224, then scale each pixel value and
normalize the resulting tensor. The part worth exploring in more detail is the
final `f32_vec_to_bytes` function -- up until the last line of the function, the
image had been transformed into an `ndarray::Array` (which, for people used to
data science in Python, should be very similar to `numpy.ndarray`). The last
line has to transform the `Array` first into a uni-dimensional `f32` array, then
into a bytes array, since this is how the WASI API transfers data. Then, it's
the runtime's responsibility to recreate the tensor properly using its desired
data type, shapes and dimensions.

Ideally, future releases of the bindings will allow guest modules to simply pass
an `ndarray::Array`, and perform the transformation automatically, based on the
shape and data type.

### Current limitations

The following represents a non-exhaustive list of known limitations of the
implementation. Depending on when this article is read, some of them might be
already resolved, and others discovered or introduced:

- only FP32 tensor types are currently supported
  ([#20](https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-nn-onnx/issues/20)) -- this is related
  to with the way state is tracked internally. It should not affect popular
  models (such as computer vision scenarios), but it represents the main
  limitation for now.
- GPU execution is not yet enabled in the native ONNX runtime
  ([#9](https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-nn-onnx/issues/9)) -- the C headers for
  the GPU API have to be used when generating the bindings for the ONNX runtime.

If you are interested in contributing, around performance, GPU support, or
compatibility, please visit the [repository and issue queue][issues] for an
updated list of open issues.

### Conclusion

This article explores the WASI NN proposal and describes how the new
implementation for ONNX is built, how it works, and how to execute such a
runtime with Wasmtime, with a few notes around pre- and post-processing for
input tensors when building guest WebAssembly modules in Rust.

Big shout-out to [Andrew Brown for his work on WASI NN][ab-1], to [Jiaxiao
Zhou][joe] for helping out with the ONNX implementation, to [Nicolas
Bigaouette][nb] for his work on the ONNX Rust bindings, and to all the [people
at Sonos building Tract][tract] and [the ONNX maintainers][msft].

This project expands the possibility for running real-world neural networks from
WebAssembly runtimes by providing near-native performance for executing
inferences for PyTorch or TensorFlow models through ONNX. This implementation,
as well as WASI NN, are still very early, but results for both ONNX runtimes and
OpenVINOâ„¢ are promising, particularly when combining this type of workload with
[outbound networking support][http], or [using cloud services from WebAssembly
modules][az].
