If you want to interact with the Kubernetes cluster API, the most obvious choice
for the programming language is Go. Since Kubernetes itself is written in Go, it
naturally became the _de facto_ language for interacting with the API, and
writing controllers is no exception.

You even have multiple choices for writing a Go controller - you can directly
use the [Go client][client-go], and follow the implementation of this
[controller sample][controller-example], or you can use
[Kubebuilder][kubebuilder], [Metacontroller], or the awesome
[`operator-sdk`][operator-sdk], all of which give you a starting point for
creating controllers that interact with custom resources.

Additionally, [`operator-sdk`][operator-sdk] also gives you an entire tool for
generating CRDs from your Go structures, and integrated commands to compile,
test, and run your controllers as you are developing them, making the experience
of building such a component a much leaner experience. And although at times it
can feel like there's _too_ much magic happening behind the scenes with
`operator-sdk`, it is _by far_ the best experience to writing an operator in Go.

That being said, not everything is perfect in the world of `client-go`. Go
dependency management is sometimes challenging, with `client-go` you have to
understand _a lot_ of packages to perform the easiest of tasks, and sometimes
it's just not possible to use Go to build your controller.

A few days ago, Matt Butcher shared a [Rust library that simplifies writing a
controller][operator-rs], which got me wondering:

<!-- {{< tweet user="technosophos" id="1124403345135939585" >}} -->

How difficult is it today to build controllers for CRDs in other programming
languages? As it turns out, the Rust library makes it really easy to get
started, with a really nice API.

And since I haven't written C# in quite some time, I decided this would be a
nice experiment for my Research Friday (although it did continue a bit through
the weekend).

### Using the C# client to build a controller

There is a [C# client for Kubernetes][kubernetes-csharp], which has great
examples, and we are going to use it in building our controller. Besides the
usual CRUD operations that you can do with the client, you can also _watch_ for
various resources - we listen on a given resource, and then we handle the events
that take place:

```
var result = await _client.ListNamespacedCustomObjectWithHttpMessagesAsync(
                group: "api group",
                version: "version,
                namespaceParameter: "namespace",
                plural: "examples",
                watch: true);

result.Watch<T>((type, item) => _handle(type, item));
```

This is pretty much the building block for our entire controller - but notice
the generic type `T` on `Watch<T>` method - it is supposed to handle custom
resources of type `T` - but how does a custom resource look like? Here's an
example:

```
apiVersion: engineerd.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Example
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-05-05T21:10:44Z"
  generation: 1
  name: my-cr-example
  namespace: kubecontroller
  resourceVersion: "12456473"
  selfLink: /apis/engineerd.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/kubecontroller/examples/my-cr-example
  uid: 3eced7fe-6f7a-11e9-ae81-fad9608c9dfa
spec:
  <fields for your custom resource specification>
status:
  <fields for the status of your custom resource>
```

All Kubernetes custom resources have:

- `apiVersion` - this describes the version for your object, and [this
  article][apiversion-blog] describes what each API version means, and which one
  you should use
- `kind` - this is the type of your custom resources, and it is defined when
  creating the custom resource definition
- `metadata` (depending on type, this can be an object, or a list metadata)

Then, you have:

- `spec`
- `status`

These fields can be used to encapsulate your own business logic in the custom
resource, and describe the desired and current state of the resource.

And because we want to cast the resources we watch to some C# types, we need to
have a class structure for the CRD. Luckily, the C# client comes in extremely
handy, and provides us with an object that contains the `apiVersion` and `kind`,
in the [`KubernetesObject`][kubernetes-object], and an object that encapsulates
the metadata, in [`V1ObjectMeta`][object-meta].

This means that we have to add the `spec` and (optionally) `status` for our CRD,
and this is (on a high level) what the `CustomResource` class in the project
looks like:

```
  public abstract class CustomResource<TSpec, TStatus>
  {
      public V1ObjectMeta Metadata { get; set; }
      public TSpec Spec { get; set; }
      public TStatus Status { get; set; }
  }
```

> In reality, there is a base, non-generic, [`CustomResource`][custom-resource]

Creating the type for your CRD comes down to building a C# class that mirrors
your custom resource.

### Wrapping everything in a `Controller` class

Now that we have the building blocks, we can create a library that contains the
custom resource class we see above (and another class that contains some
metadata about your CRD, such as group and namespace) and build a [class for our
controller][controller].

We include a cancellation token, an instance of the Kubernetes client, and some
metadata for the CRD, then pass a handler method to execute for changes in our
custom resources, and we end up with a library that can be consumed from a C#
console library as follows (for a CRD that [can be found in the
repository][crd-cr]):

```
var crd = new CustomResourceDefinition()
{
    ApiVersion = "engineerd.dev/v1alpha1",
    PluralName = "examples",
    Kind = "Example",
    Namespace = "kubecontroller"
};

var controller = new Controller<ExampleCRD>(
    new Kubernetes(KubernetesClientConfiguration.BuildConfigFromConfigFile()),
    crd,
    (WatchEventType eventType, ExampleCRD example) =>
        Console.WriteLine("Event type: {0} for {1}", eventType, example.Metadata.Name));

var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
await controller.StartAsync(cts.Token);
```

And so we end up with a really, really simple controller, where for every
change, we write the event type and name of the resource to the console. Did I
say this is a very simple controller?

Can this be improved? Sure, it's a rather naive approach to building one, but
you can see the building blocks for handling changes for your custom resources.
You can find [the current state of this controller library (as of writing this
article) in this branch of the GitHub repository][article-branch].

### Conclusion

In this article, we used the C# client for Kubernetes to build a very simple
controller that watches a custom resource for changes.

As it turns out, this was much easier than I anticipated before starting, and
the end result is arguably a lot simpler than its Go counterpart. Sure, all the
Go libraries, together with the community resources, give you much more to work
with, and I'm not arguing that anyone should stop using Go to write controllers.

But if the Rust and C# clients tell us anything about Kubernetes controllers, is
that for the simplest use cases, implementing them in other languages might
actually allow us to get started much easier (without having a `hack` directory
in our repository and depending on executing Bash scripts to generate APIs).

What other things would you need in a C# controller library for Kubernetes?
Would you like to see this as a NuGet package? Feel free to [open an issue on
the repository][issues], and feel free to send feedback.
