I'm the CTO and co-founder of [Fermyon](https://fermyon.com), where
I created [the Spin project](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) and I'm working on
building a new generation of computing platforms using Wasm.

In the past I worked at Microsoft in the
[DeisLabs](https://github.com/deislabs) research and development team, where I
was a core maintainer for several
[server-side WebAssembly](https://github.com/orgs/deislabs/repositories?q=&type=&language=rust&sort=)
and distributed systems projects like [Krustlet](https://krustlet.dev),
[Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft),
[Brigade](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade), or the
[Cloud Native Application Bundle](https://cnab.io) project.

Sometimes I write about [serious topics](/blog), and sometimes I write [short notes](/notes)
about personal projects and experiments.
