Hi, I'm Radu!

I am an open source software engineer passionate about WebAssembly, distributed
systems, and artificial intelligence, working as the co-founder and CTO of
[Fermyon](https://fermyon.com).

In the past I worked at Microsoft Azure in the
[DeisLabs](https://github.com/deislabs) research and development team, where I
was a core maintainer for multiple
[server-side WebAssembly](https://github.com/orgs/deislabs/repositories?q=&type=&language=rust&sort=)
and distributed systems projects like [Krustlet](https://krustlet.dev),
[Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft),
[Brigade](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade), or the
[Cloud Native Application Bundle](cnab.io) project (building the distribution
and security specifications).

I am an avid learner, I love classical music (and am excited about learning to
play the piano), and I enjoy a good bubble tea with a bicycle ride.

This is the place I will write about things I am working on — this includes (but
not limited to) WebAssembly, Rust, or machine learning. Sometimes I also write
about non-technical topics — you can find all of them under the
[#personal](/tags/personal/) tag.

If you need to, you can find me on the Internet:
