I've been writing on this blog since 2016.
I've written about [.NET](/blog/self-contained-dotnet-cli/),
[WebSockets](/blog/aspnet-core-websockets-middleware/), [debugging microservices on Kubernetes](/blog/state-of-debugging-microservices-on-k8s/),
or about [WebAssembly memory](/blog/practical-guide-to-wasm-memory/).

I rarely have the time to write lengthy blog posts anymore, and social media
seems to be the worst place to have a conversation these days; so I stopped
posting almost entirely.

I'm trying to change that with a new [notes](/tags/notes)
section of my blog where I'm trying to write more by sharing something
in-between a tweet and a fully fledged blog post.
I might write about personal projects and experiments around Wasm, Spin, distributed
systems, dotfiles and fonts, interesting conference talks, or bike rides.

If any of that seems remotely interesting, [follow along](/index.xml)!
