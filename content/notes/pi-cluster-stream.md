I recently built a 5-node Raspberry Pi cluster running Wasm workloads using the
new [SpinKube project](https://github.com/spinkube).

This week, I joined [Fermyon's weekly live stream](https://www.youtube.com/@fermyontech/streams)
together with [Sohan](https://twitter.com/soganmageshwar) to talk about how I configured
the cluster and to demonstrate running Spin applications on Kubernetes.

You can [follow along this gist](https://gist.github.com/radu-matei/fa659492cd9ddea999ce5a9d789b653d)
to set up your own cluster, and stay tuned for a full write-up on this setup.
